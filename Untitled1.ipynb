Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening any business place like Grocery Store in Vancouver, Canada. The first task would be to choose the safest borough by analysing crime data for opening a grocery store and short listing a neighbourhood, where grocery stores are not amongst the most commom venues, and yet as close to the city as possible. I will make use of data science tools to analyse data and focus on the safest borough and explore its neighborhoods and the 10 most common venues in each neighborhood so that the best neighborhood where grocery store is not amongst the most common venue can be selected.\n\n***Part 2: Identifying Neighborhoods inside Vancouver***\n\nWe will use Postal Codes of different regions inside Vancouver to find the list of neighborhoods. We will essentially obtain our information from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighbourhoods_in_Vancouver and then process the table inside this site. Images from dataframes and also from maps will be provided in the presentation. Here we only present our strategy and how we got the mission accomplished.\n\n***Part 3: Connecting to Foursquare and Retrieving Locational Data for Each Venue in Every Neighborhood***\n\nAfter finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 1000 meter. It means that we have asked Foursquare to find venues that are at most 1000 meter far from the center of the neighborhood. (I think distance is measured by latitude and longitude of venues and neighborhoods, and it is not the walking distance for venues.)\n\n***Part 4: Processing the Retrieved Data and Creating a DataFrome for All the Venues in Vancouver***\n\nWhen the data is completely gathered, we will perform processing on that raw data to find our desirable features for each venue. Our main feature is the category of that venue. After this stage, the column \"Venue's Category\" wil be One-hot encoded and different venues will have different feature-columns. After On-hot encoding we will integrate all restaurant columns to one column \"Total Restaurants\" and all food joint columns to \"Total Joints\" column. We assumed that different resaturants use the Same raw groceries. This assumption is made for simplicity and due to not having a very detailed dataset about different venues.\nNow, the dataset is fully ready to be used for machine learning (and statistical analysis) purposes.\n\n***Part 5: Applying one of Machine Learning Techniques (K-Means Clustering)***\n\nHere we cluster neighborhoods via K-means clustering method. We think that 5 clusters is enough and can cover the complexity of our problem. After clustering we will update our dataset and create a column representing the group for each neighborhood.\n\n***Decision Making and Reporting Results***\n\nNow, we focus on the centers of clusters and compare them for their \"Total Restaurants\" and their \"Total Joints\". The group which its center has the highest \"Total Sum\" will be our best recommendation to the contractor. {Note: Total Sum = Total Restaurants + Total Joints + Other Venues.} This algorithm although is pretty straightforward yet is strongly powerful.\n\n***Results:***\n\nThe objective of the business problem was to help stakeholders identify one of the safest borough in Vancouver, and an appropriate neighborhood within the borough to set up a commercial establishment especially a Grocery store. This has been achieved by first making use of Vancouver crime data to identify a safe borugh with considerable number of neighborhood for any business to be viable. After selecting the borough it was imperative to choose the right neighborhood where grocery shops were not among venues in a close proximity to each other. I achieved this by grouping the neighborhoods into clusters to assist the stakeholders by providing them with relavent data about venues and safety of a given neighborhood.\n\n***Conclusion:***\n\nI have explored the crime data to understand different types of crimes in all neighborhoods of Vancouver and later categorized them into different boroughs, this helped me group the neighborhoods into boroughs and choose the safest borough first. Once I confirmed the borough the number of neighborhoods for consideration also comes down, I further shortlist the neighborhoods based on the common venues, to choose a neighborhood which best suits the business problem.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
